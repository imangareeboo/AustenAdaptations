It is a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen's enduring popularity in Western Anglophone literature has been remarkably on the rise, however little known her works may have been in the years proceeding her death. Her legacy as a woman writer, publishing at a time when novels written by women were often credited simply as being written by "A Lady," has been complicated by the efforts of her family, the Austen-Leighs, in crafting an image of a dear "Aunt Jane," as well as by the support of male English authors, like Rudyard Kipling, and the use of her works in the Cambridge International Education system, itself a legacy of British colonial practice. 

In other words, Jane Austen remains an enigmatic, somewhat mysterious figure, no matter the lengths that researchers go to in sifting through her novels, her letters, and her juvenilia. 

Excitingly, whether they grew up with Austen culturally or learned about Austen through colonially-inflected education, many people around the world put much effort into adapting Austen through their own eyes. With the advent of the popular film and tv adaptations of the 1990s and early 2000s, many people enter the Austen fandom through the media representations and work their way back to the books and to Austen herself. 

This project breaks down the adaptations already published or released by the novels they sought to adapt. Some adaptations clearly align with one Austen work, others meld influences from multiple sources. Below, you will find the 6 Austen novels listed with posts for the adaptations of each in chronological order. You will also find a category for Austen's Juvenilia and Unfinished Works, as well as a category for Other Austen Resources of interest.
